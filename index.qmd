Hey there!! I am a rising junior majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics at Mount Holyoke College. I am interested in creating tech products that can be used for the public good, which is exactly why I am also pursuing a Nexus in Law, Public Policy and Human Rights. 


I am currently exploring Computer Science research, specifically, those that fall under Human-Computer Interactions as well as the application of Computer Science in other fields as a data exploration research tool

library(magrittr)

# save image as ggplot

  image_ggplot(interpolate = TRUE)
